Users with weak passwords on MyBitcoin who used the same password on Mt. Gox were in for a surprise after the June 2011 Mt. Gox Incident allowed weakly-salted hashes of all Mt. Gox user passwords to be leaked. These passwords were then hacked on MyBitcoin and a significant amount of money lost.

MyBitcoin estimates indicate 1% of MyBitcoin users were affected. Users that were not affected would be later stolen from anyways, due to the subsequent MyBitcoin Theft.
